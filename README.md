Car Owner Analytics Dashboard
An interactive data visualization dashboard built with Python Dash and Plotly that explores relationships between car owners' demographic characteristics and their vehicle preferences. This project demonstrates data generation, interactive filtering, and advanced visualization techniques for demographic and automotive data analysis.

📊 Project Overview
This dashboard provides an interactive interface to analyze correlations between owner demographics (age, gender, income, occupation) and vehicle characteristics (make, model, fuel type, body style, engine size). The project includes both a synthetic data generator and multiple dashboard implementations with varying levels of complexity.
